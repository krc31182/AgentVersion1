# Finance Agent - My First Agent

I built my first AI agent by using Phi dataâ€™s library and framework. The goal of the agent is to retrieve financial information and analysis of stocks. 
To achieve this I imported Yahoo finance tools and coded the agent to retrieve information from either Groq or Chat Gpt depending on the task. The agent successfully retrieves all relevant stock information in table format. It also retrieves an analysis from financial experts on the stocks that were prompted and recommendations based on their opinions. 
This was my first try at building an AI agent.
